Aim: reproducing reference results from book and from master branch of movsim's version 1.1.

Workplan: 

1. Start with onramp_IDM.xml: 
* upstream boundary ?
* simpleOnramp dropping mechanism
* spatiotemporal output


2. Simulate IDM model family and other continuous models

3. Simulate iterated maps (Gipps and Krauss)

4. Simulate cellular automata
* Model input is still in scaled quantities.
