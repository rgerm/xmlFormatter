* FVDM does not obey speed limit if there are other vehicles (far) in front

* Cellular automata do not yet obey speed limits. We could try to map speed limits 
  to the nearest multiple of the elementary speed step. Maybe, a 
  warning would be appropriate if an imposed speed limits is uneffective 
  because it does not change the integer speed.

* Check also speed limit for two road segments (must be reset on second road segment)
